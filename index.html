          <h4>OU Project (title pending grade)</h4>
          <p>This project involved developing a Python program that implements a simple cipher generator based on a
            birth month key. The program takes a user's birth month as input and uses it to generate a unique encryption
            key. This key is then used to encrypt and decrypt messages using a combination of AES-CBC encryption and a
            key derivation function (KDF). The program also includes error handling to ensure robustness and
            user-friendliness.</p>
          <p>Key features:</p>

          <h4>Edgehill NLP Sentiment Analysis</h4>
          <p>This project involved applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyse a dataset of video
            game reviews and determine the sentiment expressed in each review. The program utilises the NLTK library in
            Python to perform sentiment analysis on individual sentences within the reviews and then aggregates those
            scores to classify each review as positive or negative. The project also includes an exploration of Named
            Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and extract key entities mentioned in the reviews.</p>
          <p>Key features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentiment analysis using TextBlob to determine the polarity of individual sentences and overall reviews.

            <li>Algorithm development for classifying reviews as positive or negative based on aggregated sentiment
              scores.</li>
            <li>Named Entity Recognition (NER) using NLTK to identify and extract key entities from the text.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Determining an appropriate threshold for classifying reviews based on sentiment scores.</li>
            <li>Handling inconsistencies and nuances in language to ensure accurate sentiment analysis.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Lessons learned:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The practical application of NLP techniques for analyzing text data and extracting meaningful insights.
            </li>
            <li>The importance of considering context and nuances in language when performing sentiment analysis.</li>
            <li>The value of combining different NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis and NER, to gain a more
